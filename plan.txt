# Goals I have for this project

 *. There will be a program window that shows up upon starting the 
    game.

 *. When you first open the game there will be a starting menu with
    two buttons side by side, the first one to the left will say 
    "play against a bot" and the one to the right will say "play 
    against your friend". You will be able to click on them with
    your mousecursor.

 *. It must have a database that will store your account along with
    your stats. 

 *. In the window there will a 11x11 game board that occupies the entire screen
    of the window.

 *. The game must have a GUI for the game board and a HUD that displays how many 
    pieces that have been captured and whose turn it is and also how many moves
    that have been made so far in total during the entire game session.

 *. You will be able to move an individual piece with your mousecursor by first
    clicking on the piece you want to move and then click on the box where you 
    want that piece to move to. If you left click on a box where the piece cannot 
    move to then the move will be resetted and make so that you have to try again by
    clicking on that piece you wanted to move (or a different one) until you moved it 
    validly. If you choose to right click when after left clicking a piece then the
    choosing is resetted so that you can think again before you move. You won't be
    able to hold left click and make the piece hover with the cursor to where you 
    want it to be placed, you can only single click on the piece and then move the 
    cursor to the destination and then single click it there to move the piece.

 *. You will be able to play against your friend or against a bot. 


 # Data structures and other things that I will use

  1. A 11x11 2D array called "board" that will handle the game 
    logic like all of the seperate coordinates of the different
    pieces.

  2. 4 different #define macros for the different types of pieces
     that can occupy any box on the board. "EMPTY" is defined as
     the number 0 and is not a piece but the logical value of a 
     box that is empty and has no piece on it yet, "ATTACKER" is 
     defined as the number 1 and is the piece for the black pieces 
     on the sides that attack the white pieces in the middle, 
     "DEFENDER" is defined as the number 2 and is the piece for the 
     white pieces that cover and defend the king in the middle and
     lastly the "KING" is defined as the number 4 and is the piece
     that is the white king that the other white defenders defend
     from the black pieces who are attacking them. 
     
       * Each starting coordinate of the pieces: 

         * Black attacker pieces: 

         * White defender pieces:

         * The white king:  


 # The game rules

    Objective
    The dark pieces (attackers) lay siege, their goal, to capture the king. The light pieces (defenders) 
    must break the siege and get their king to safety.

    1. Two players, the king's side vs attackers. There are twice as many attackers as defenders.

    2. The attackers' side moves first, the players then take turns.

    3. All pieces move any number of vacant squares along a row or a column, like a rook in chess.

    4. Capture 
    All pieces except the king are captured if sandwiched between two enemy pieces, 
    or between an enemy piece and a restricted square. The two enemy pieces should 
    be on the square above and below or on the squares left and right of the attacked 
    piece, i.e. not diagonally.

    A piece is only captured if the trap is closed by the aggressor's move, it is 
    therefore permitted to move in between two enemy pieces. The king may take part in captures.

    5. Restricted squares
    Restricted squares may only be occupied by the king. The central restricted square is called the throne. 
    It is allowed for the king to re-enter the throne, and all pieces may pass through the throne when it is 
    empty.

    Restricted squares are hostile, which means they can replace one of the two pieces taking part in a capture. 
    The throne is always hostile to the attackers, but only hostile to the defenders when it is empty. The four 
    corner squares are also restricted and hostile, just like the throne. The board edge is NOT hostile.

    6. King's side win
    If the king reaches any corner square, the king has escaped and his side wins.

    7a. Attackers win
    The attackers win if they can capture the king.

    The king is captured when the attackers surround him on all four cardinal points, 
    except when he is next to the throne.

    If on a square next to the throne, the attackers must occupy the three remaining squares around him.

    The king cannot be captured on the board edge, UNLESS he is the only white piece remaining on the 
    board and is completely surrounded by black (i.e. rule 8).

    7b. If the attackers surround the king and ALL remaining defenders, then they win, as they have 
    prevented the king from escaping.

    8. If a player cannot move, he loses the game.

    9. If it is not possible to end the game, fx. because both sides have too few pieces left or because 
    of repetitions, it is a draw.
