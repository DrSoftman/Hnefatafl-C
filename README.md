  This is an open-source project of the ancient board game Hnefatafl which was played 
  during the Viking Age in Scandinavia by Norsemen. 
  
  Please feel free to suggest any improvements in a pull request to this project if 
  you notice any problems with it upon usage!

  As of now (March 11th 2025, when I am writing this) this project is not fully complete, only the terminal
  version is complete but not the GUI version. So I want to also clarify that if you 
  wish to contribute, then you should point your eyes to improving the GUI version 
  and not the terminal (TERM) version.
